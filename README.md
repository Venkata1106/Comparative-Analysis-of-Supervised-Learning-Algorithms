Comparative Analysis of Supervised Learning Algorithms for Apartment Rental Pricing



This project conducts a comprehensive evaluation of various supervised learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Trees. The objective is to identify the most effective algorithm under various conditions and optimize them for predicting apartment rental prices. The project is structured around multiple phases: data preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the "Apartment for Rent Classified," which includes features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, city, and rental prices. This dataset provides a detailed snapshot of the current rental property market across various cities.
